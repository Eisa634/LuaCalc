# LuaCalc
A simple Lua CMD Calculator consisting of 20 LOC. (Requires Lua Runtime(Duh))

This is a simple Command Line Calculator made in Lua, this is my first lua project and I made it in about 10 minutes.
It is very small and can be run using any Lua runtime.

# To use it #

Simply run the file and choose one of the four operations listed:
+ = Addition
- = Subtraction
* = Multiplication
/ = Division

The answer will be displayed in a sentence showing your answer e.g "Your answer is: 12"

# Future #

This will be the start of many simple Lua projects like this.
